# Friend-Finder
Web Application Development Boot Camp Week 13: Friend Finder

### Goal: 
To build a server using express that has back-end processing to serve a json response.  

It's built in the form of a Friend Finder survey. The user is presented with a Home screen with a link to the survey.  The survey asks for a name, image link, then asks you to rate from 1-5 a number of items based on how much you like/dislike them. 

The user is then presented with their match.

## Installation
To install, download the files and use npm to install the required packages.

```
npm install
```

Then run the server file using node
```
node server.js
```
Proceed to navigate to the opened port on localhost.
